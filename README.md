MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification


This repository contains an implementation of a handwritten digit classification system using various machine learning models. The models are trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning.

About the MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It consists of:

60,000 training images
10,000 test images
Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models in the field of image classification.

Models Implemented
The following machine learning models are implemented in this repository:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Each model is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
